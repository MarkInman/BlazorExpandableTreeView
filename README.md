# Blazor Expandable TreeView Component Tutorial

This repository contains code examples and explanations for creating a simple expandable treeview blazor component based on recursion. The associated YouTube video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/eiiS99XJYH4).

## Overview

In this video, we'll walk through creating a dynamic and expandable TreeView component in Blazor. Learn the intricacies of recursive programming as we delve into building a tree structure with expandable nodes. 
Discover how to implement event callbacks to handle user interactions. It's important to note that in this tutorial, our primary focus will be on the functionality, and we won't be delving into styling the component. 
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of crafting a powerful recursive TreeView in Blazor, ready for your own customization and styling preferences.
